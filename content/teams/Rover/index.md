# About the Team

On the Mars Rover team, students are responsible for designing, developing, and implementing every aspect of the rover - from custom PCBs, a six-axis arm, to autonomous navigation software. The rover itself has been iterated on over decades, creating a lasting legacy for OSU students and alumni. 

The rover team welcomes students of all skill levels and majors. Students are free to work on projects that interest them and are not confined to projects that align with their major. Because of this, motivated students often develop skills across mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. Apart from building technical and teamwork skills, students build relationships with other motivated future engineers and have the opportunity to connect with club alumni. Club alumni commonly help with acquiring internships and jobs after graduation.

DAM Robotics' Rover Team competes at two competitions: the Canadian International Rover Challenge (CIRC) in Drumheller, Alberta, Canada, and the University Rover Challenge (URC) in Hanksville, Utah.
